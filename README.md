Very first repo

Hi

I'm Collins Mbaka,  User experience designer

I appreciate the beauty of life, i think life is a beautiful design, an example of the perfect design.
Design issa way of life, its trying to find or create solutions to well defined problem, you can say using
design methodologies, i like to see it as persistent experimentation or just simply staying focused on
solving a known problem, doing whatever it takes to get it done, However you know best.
